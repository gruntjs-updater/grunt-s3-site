grunt-s3-site
=============

Create and deploy static websites to Amazon S3.


## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```
npm install grunt-s3-site --save-dev
```

Once the plsgin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-s3-site');
```


## The "s3_site" task

### Overview

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `s3site` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```
grunt.initConfig({
  s3site: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    },
  },
});
```

### Options

#### options.separator
Type: `String`
Default value: `',  '`

A string value that is used to do something with whatever.

### Usage Examples

In this example, the default options are used to do something with whatever. So if the `testing` file has the content `Testing` and the `123` file had the content `1 2 3`, the generated result would be `Testing, 1 2 3.`

```
grunt.initConfig({
  s3_site: {
    options: {},
    files: {
      'dest/default_options': ['src/testing', 'src/123'],
    },
  },
});
```
